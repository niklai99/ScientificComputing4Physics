# Scientific Computing for Physics Students

This page serves as a central hub for all homework assignments (tasks) given throughout the course. Each task can be accessed from the **[Task Section](#homework--task-overview)** below, or from the navigation bar at the top-left of the webpage, beneath the course title. Within each task, you will find multiple pages dedicated to different sub-tasks, each providing a step-by-step explanation and the rationale behind every choice.

!!! warning
    This webpage is actively maintained and updated as the course progresses. **Currently, only Task 1 is fully documented.** More tasks will appear in the future.

## Syllabus

### Target Skills and Knowledge
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Effectively handle and combine scientific computing tools.
2. Independently research and gather necessary information for coding projects.
3. Design and develop code tailored to specific research needs.
4. Critically evaluate and efficiently use the most suitable tools for given tasks, balancing ease of use and optimization.
5. Demonstrate a fundamental understanding of computer science concepts, enabling autonomous further learning as needed.
6. Apply programming skills specifically oriented towards scientific applications.
7. Analyze and solve complex scientific problems using computational methods.
8. Articulate the trade-offs between different computational approaches in scientific contexts.


### Examination Methods
An oral examination where students present and defend multiple micro-projects developed throughout the course, demonstrating their understanding and application of key concepts.

### Assessment Criteria
Critically analyze and evaluate coding micro-projects presented during the course, identifying potential pitfalls and proposing effective design strategies to overcome them.

### Course Unit Contents
Coding forms the core of scientific computing, embodying a dual nature: one deeply rooted in established practices, and another driven by constant innovation. Throughout this course, we will strive to strike a balance between these two aspects.
